We need a MySQL-focused tutorial on using MySQL with Perl and DBI. The article should probably include:

* links to how to install/setup MySQL Server
* Installing DBI and DBD::MySQL
* connecting to the database
* executing queries with "do"
* how to read data from query results

The article body goes here. Use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to write the article body. Don't forget to delete this line!
