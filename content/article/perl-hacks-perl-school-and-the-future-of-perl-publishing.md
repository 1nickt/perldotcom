Dave Cross, long-time Perl user, trainer, and author, recently released [The Best of Perl Hacks](https://perlhacks.com/2020/04/the-best-of-perl-hacks/), a curated collection of his best posts from his [Perl Hacks blog](https://perlhacks.com). His imprint, [Perl School](https://perlschool.com), has published five e-books, including two that I wrote.

There's an unrelated book, [Perl Hacks: Tips & Tools For Programming, Debugging, And Surviving](), by chromatic, Damian Conway, and Curtis "Ovid" Poe. It's also very good, but completely separate from Dave's.

## What is Perl Hacks? When did you start it and what do you like to post there?


## How did you choose what went into the ebook? What are some of your favorite posts? Which ones got the best responses?


## What is Perl School? Why did you start it? What was the first book?


## What was your experience giving low-cost and free Perl training in the UK?


## You previously wrote the print books [Data Munging with Perl](https://www.manning.com/books/data-munging-with-perl) (Manning Press) and [Template Toolkit](http://www.template-toolkit.org/book.html) (O'Reilly & Associates, with Andy Wardley and Darren Chamberlain). How is Perl School's process different than what you experienced with those publishers?

## What do you think are the biggest challenges to technical publishing today? How does something like Perl School respond to that?

## What are your personal reading preferences? Which device do you like, what size screen do you need, and which format works best for you?

## How can someone write a book for Perl School? What topics do you think would be most interesting?
